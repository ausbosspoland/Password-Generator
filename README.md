# Password-Generator

### This webpage was made to provide new, secure passwords

### while loop used to keep password length between 8 and 128 characters

### switches used for user input

### couldnt get the button to work at the end and I need to start working on Web API's challenge already, you could say im behind

### had trouble with this one for sure, still trying to figure out git hub and setting upstream branch and having permission to repository, couldn't google enough stuff to figure it out.
